# iMessage Concept

This app prototype implemented using Quartz Composer. Was part of a talk given to the Triangle CocoaHeads in May 2013.

This was created a part of a [Triangle CocoaHeads](http://www.meetup.com/nscoderrtp/) presentation I gave on using [Prototyping with Quartz Composer](http://jaythrash.com/talks/prototyping-with-quartz-composer/) in May 2013.

In order to run this composition, you'll need to have [Quartz Composer](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#) installed.  ( Free download for registered Apple developers.)
