# iMessenger Concept

This app prototype implemented using Quartz Composer. This was created a part of a [Triangle CocoaHeads](http://www.meetup.com/nscoderrtp/) presentation I gave on  [Prototyping with Quartz Composer](http://jaythrash.com/talks/prototyping-with-quartz-composer/) in May 2013. An explanation of how the demo was constructed is covered in that presentation.

In order to run this composition, you'll need to have [Quartz Composer](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#) installed.  ( Free download for registered Apple developers.)
